    "# Quran & Sentence Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the most common verse in the Quran? To answer this question and similar others we can use sentence transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Downloaded an English Quran translation here: https://tanzil.net/trans/ -- This notebook uses [this](https://tanzil.net/trans/en.itani) --copied to `data/en.itani.txt`.\n",
    "2. Encoded all the verses with the [best performing](https://paperswithcode.com/task/semantic-textual-similarity) sentence transformer and saved the embeddings: `data/en_itani.p` -- took 1 hour on my machine\n",
    "3. Calculated cosine similarities of all pairs of verses --thus got a matrix of size (6236,6236).\n",
    "4. For each verse, counted the number of verses to which it is \"very similar\" -- i.e., where `cosine similarity >.80`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "1. The most repeated verse is about God's greatness.\n",
    "2. The second most repeated verse is about God's forgiveness."
